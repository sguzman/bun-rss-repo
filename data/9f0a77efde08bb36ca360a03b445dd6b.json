  "description": "Consumer Confidence in Indonesia increased to 120.30 points in October from 117.20 points in September of 2022. Consumer Confidence in Indonesia averaged 100.09 points from 2000 until 2022, reaching an all time high of 128.90 points in May of 2022 and a record low of 9.60 points in March of 2001. In Indonesia, the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) measures consumer’s expectations about current income and job availability against those 6 months ago, appropriate time to buy durable goods, and general economic conditions and job availability expectations in the next 6 months. The index is based on a survey of around 4600 middle up class households in major cities (those cities cover about 78 percent of GDP). Data is collected through phone interviews and direct visits. The two main components of the Index are the current economic condition index and the consumer expectation index. The CCI is computed as a net balance obtained from the difference between percentage on ’increase’ answer and percentage on ’decrease’ answer. An index above 100 indicates an improving outlook and below 100 a deteriorating outlook.
