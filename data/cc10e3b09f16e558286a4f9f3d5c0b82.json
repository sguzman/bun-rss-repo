  "description": "Electricity prices in Spain bottomed below EUR 200 per megawatt hour, down more than 60% from the record-high of EUR 545 reached in March due to LNG oversupply and lower demand. Dozens of ships with LNG are anchored off the coasts of Spain, unable to secure slots to unload because of a lack of regasification capacity as Spanish terminals need more pipelines to ship the gas held in storage to other parts of Europe. As a result, natural gas prices for gas-fired power plants fell for the first time below the cap of EUR 40 set in May, with the Spanish national grid operator saying it might reject LNG shipments. With electricity costs intrinsically linked to natural gas prices, Spain and Portugal have been benefiting from an agreement earlier this year to separate the price paid for natural gas used in the energy mix from that paid for the less costly sources like solar, nuclear, or hydroelectric power. Electricity Price in Spain averaged 50.79 EUR/MWh from 1998 until 2022, reaching an all time high of 544.98 EUR/MWh in March of 2022 and a record low of 0.79 EUR/MWh in March of 2013. Electricity prices displayed in Trading Economics are current spot benchmarks offered by sellers to buyers priced in megawatts per hour (MWh) in the local currency.
