  "description": "The People's Bank of China kept its key lending rates unchanged for a second straight month at October fixing, amid a rapid decline in the yuan and as policymakers tried to avoid stark policy divergence with other major economies. The one-year loan prime rate (LPR), which uses for corporate and household loans, was kept at 3.65%; while the five-year rate, a reference for mortgages, was maintained at 4.3%. In August, China cut benchmark interest rates following a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and a lingering property downturn. The central bank earlier this week maintained its medium-term policy rate at 2.75% while offering no injection or withdrawal from the banking system. The PBoC drained a net CNY 200 billion yuan each in August and September. Interest Rate in China averaged 4.41 percent from 2013 until 2022, reaching an all time high of 5.77 percent in April of 2014 and a record low of 3.65 percent in August of 2022. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) on August 17th, 2019, designated the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) the new lending benchmark for new bank loans to households and businesses, replacing the central bank’s benchmark one-year lending rate. The rate is based on a weighted average of lending rates from 18 commercial banks, which will submit their LPR quotations, based on what they have bid for PBOC liquidity in open market operations, to the national interbank funding center before 9am CST on the 20th of every month.
