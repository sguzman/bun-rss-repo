  "description": "Electricity prices in Italy fell to €120 per megawatt hour in early November, hovering at levels not seen since August of 2021 as success in diversifying energy sources and reduced consumption due to mild weather erased concerns of a shortage ahead of the winter. European natural gas prices declined sharply in October as full storages and increased LNG imports offset the halt in gas flows through the Nord Stream I pipeline. Electricity prices also fell due to EU measures to lower soaring electricity bills, including joint gas purchases to prevent member-states from outbidding each other and a mandatory cut in electricity consumption during peak hours. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine started, Rome has also struck new deals with Algeria and Angola to boost natural gas imports from Africa, reducing their vulnerability to the lack of supply from Russia. Previous shortage concerns lifted Italian electricity prices to a record-high of €650 at the end of August. Electricity Price in Italy averaged 79.29 EUR/MWh from 2004 until 2022, reaching an all time high of 737.43 EUR/MWh in August of 2022 and a record low of 10.66 EUR/MWh in May of 2020.
