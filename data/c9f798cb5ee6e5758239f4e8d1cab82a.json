  "description": "Moody’s Investors Service downgraded on October 21st 2022 the United Kingdom’s sovereign credit rating outlook to negative from stable and affirmed the debt grade at ‘Aa3’, citing as the main reasons behind the decision: 1) heightened unpredictability in policymaking amid a volatile domestic political landscape, which challenges the UK's ability to manage the shock arising from weaker growth prospects and high inflation; and 2) risks to the UK's debt affordability from likely higher borrowing and risk of a sustained weakening in policy credibility. The move follows major ratings agency Fitch which cut the outlook for its credit rating on UK government debt earlier this month to \"negative\" from \"stable\" in the wake of the mini-budget. Standard & Poor's credit rating for the United Kingdom stands at AA with negative outlook. Fitch's credit rating for the United Kingdom was last reported at AA- with negative outlook. DBRS's credit rating for the UK is AA (high) with outlook under review. In general, a credit rating is used by sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and other investors to gauge the credit worthiness of the United Kingdom thus having a big impact on the country's borrowing costs. This page includes the government debt credit rating for the United Kingdom as reported by major credit rating agencies.",
