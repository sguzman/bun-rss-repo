  "description": "Fitch's Ratings on Thursday revised Peru's outlook to negative from stable and affirmed long-term foreign currency issuer default rating at BBB. Fitch said that a deterioration in political stability and government effectiveness had increased downside risk to the country's ratings. The agency said it expects the weakening of Peru's political governance institutions will be difficult to reverse before the end of 2024, adding that \"weaker governance poses greater downside risks to investment and economic growth\" than the agency had expected earlier this year. Standard & Poor's credit rating for Peru stands at BBB with stable outlook. Moody's credit rating for Peru was last set at Baa1 with stable outlook. DBRS's credit rating for Peru is N/A with n/a outlook. In general, a credit rating is used by sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and other investors to gauge the credit worthiness of Peru thus having a big impact on the country's borrowing costs. This page includes the government debt credit rating for Peru as reported by major credit rating agencies.",
