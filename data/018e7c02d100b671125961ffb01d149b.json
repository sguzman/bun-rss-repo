  "description": "Weekly Economic Index in the United States decreased to 2.10 percent in November 4 from 2.35 percent in the previous week. Weekly Economic Index in the United States averaged 1.68 percent from 2008 until 2022, reaching an all time high of 11.21 percent in April of 2021 and a record low of -9.48 percent in May of 2020. The Weekly Economic Index is an index of real economic activity using timely and relevant high-frequency data. It represents the common component of ten different daily and weekly series covering consumer behavior, the labor market, and production. The WEI is scaled to the four-quarter GDP growth rate; for example, if the WEI reads -2 percent and the current level of the WEI persists for an entire quarter, we would expect, on average, GDP that quarter to be 2 percent lower than a year previously. This page includes a chart with historical data for the United States Weekly Economic Index.",
