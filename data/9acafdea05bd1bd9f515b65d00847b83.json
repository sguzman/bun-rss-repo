  "description": "BRC Retail Sales Monitor YoY in the United Kingdom decreased to 1.20 percent in October from 1.80 percent in September of 2022. BRC Retail Sales Monitor YoY in the United Kingdom averaged 1.91 percent from 1995 until 2022, reaching an all time high of 39.60 percent in April of 2021 and a record low of -4.90 percent in November of 2019. The BRC-KPMG Retail Sales Monitor measures changes in the actual value of retail sales from a sample of retailers. The Monitor measures the value of spending and hence does not adjust for price changes. If prices are rising, sales volumes will increase by less than sales values. In times of price deflation, sales volumes will increase by more than sales values. Retailers report the value of their sales and sales in the equivalent week a year ago. These figures are reported both in total and on a ‘like-for-like’ basis. The percentage increase in the value of sales on a ‘like-for-like’ basis removes the effect of the expansion of retail floor space by the retailers concerned on their sales total. Due to the sample being biased towards large retailers, the ‘like-for-like’ increase usually provides a more accurate guide to general spending patterns, though it will be biased downwards as an estimate of the growth rate for retail as a whole.
